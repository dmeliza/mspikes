## mspikes

**mspikes** is a general-purpose tool for processing time-varying data. It can
read and write various formats and perform a range of filtering and detection
operations. You can:

* filter acoustic recordings
* extract field potentials and spike waveforms from extracellular neural recordings
* export spike times and waveforms for spike sorting (using third-party programs) and import the results
* export spike times to generic formats
* add processing modules as plugins
* design your own mulithreaded processing pipelines using existing or plugin modules
