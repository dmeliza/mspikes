Python scripts and modules for processing spike data from SABER, a
data acquisition program that stores data in pcm_seq2 format and
writes metadata to a flat 'explog' text file.  The spike_extract
script is used to read the explog file and extract spike times and
features from the pcm data, exporting to files readable by the
Klusters spike-sorting software; the groupevents script reads sorted
cluster files generated by Klusters and outputs toe_lis data.
