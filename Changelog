2.2.0:

	* mspike_group: has -T option to output unsorted toelis files
	* spikes.c: no longer has fixed length refractory period in detector
	  instead, it iterates forward until the signal dips below threshold
	* mspike_group: reports ISI violations
	* mspike_shape: now works
	* multiple: changes downstream of arf 1.1.0

2.0:
	* mspike_extract: requires channel names
	* mspike_extract: no longer supports channel groups
	* multiple: uses arf files instead of klugdy parsed explog

pre 2.0:
	This early version uses pytables to store a parsed version of the
	explog file. Much of the window discrimination and PCA code was
	under active development.
