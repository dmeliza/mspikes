The data in this directory are an example recording from a single site
in starling CMM.

To look at the statistics of the episodes:
$ mspike_view --stats st317_6_2.arf

To look at oscillograms of the episodes:
$ mspike_view st317_6_2.arf

To extract spikes above the 4.5x RMS threshold,
excluding the episode with a movement artefact:
$ mspike_extract -r 4.5 -t 600 st317_6_2.arf

Open the cluster files in klusters; there should be two clusters:
$ klusters st317_6_2.clu.1

After separating cluster, store the spike times in the ARF file,
and output toe_lis files:
$ mspike_group -a -t st317_6_2.arf

To view labelled oscillograms:
$ mspike_view st317_6_2.arf
