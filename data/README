The data in this directory are an example recording from a single site
in starling CMM.

First, process the explog file by running "spike_extract st317.explog".
This will generate the st317.explog.h5 file and sort all the pcm_seq2 files
into a directory called site_6_2

To look at the statistics of the episodes:
spike_view --stats -p 6 -s 2 st317.explog.h5

To look at oscillograms of the episodes:
spike_view -p 6 -s 2 st317.explog.h5

To extract spikes above the 4.5x RMS threshold:
spike_extract -p 6 -s 2 -r 4.5 st317.explog.h5

Open the cluster files in klusters; there should be two clusters:
klusters site_6_2.clu.1

After separating clusters, to view labelled oscillograms:
spike_view -p 6 -s 2 --units=site_6_2.clu.1 st317.explog.h5

To generate toelis file for each stimulus:
groupevents site_6_2 st317.explog.h5
